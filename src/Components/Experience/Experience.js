        <p>
            In 2014, coding wasn't even on my radar until I joined my high school's robotics team. 
            Witnessing how code made the robot's modules come to life ignited a passion in me that has only grown stronger over the years. 
            Since then, I have had the privilege of working for a diverse array of companies, from a cybersecurity startup to a massive automotive company, 
            a compiler company, a supply chain team, and an insurance firm. Each experience has enriched my skills and knowledge, shaping me into a versatile fullstack engineer.

        <p>
            My main focus now is to continue expanding my expertise in APIs, frameworks, and UI design. 
            I strive to create code that is not only reliable and efficient but also engaging and user-friendly. 
            I find the most satisfaction in building software that sits at the intersection of design and engineeringâ€”solutions that are visually appealing yet robust and well-constructed under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, drawing, and hiking. These hobbies allow me to stay creative and curious, constantly exploring new ideas and challenges.
